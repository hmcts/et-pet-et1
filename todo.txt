BUGS
1. DONE Payment date unknown does not seem to be being persisted and causing a failure on review page for some reason
2. The state of the continue button on the first 2 pages should not start off as disabled - but should be calculated from the value of the relevant questions

Sporadics:
1. rspec ./spec/features/admin_panel/admin_show_feature_spec.rb:145

Testing:
1. Accessible gem - for testing aria stuff

Unit Tests:
1. Applicant form (validation, standard form stuff, stripping of first and last names)
2. Bank details form (validation, standard form stuff)
3. Confirmation form (no validation, standard form stuff - very basic)
4. Fees form - (Validation (complex), standard form stuff, partial payment date, conversion of fees to integer, conversion of fees from nil/string/integer)
5. Original case details form - (validation (medium complex), standard form stuff, address transfer, name transfer
6. Profile selection form - (validation (simple - needs adding of valid values), standard form stuff)
7. Review form - (validation of accept declaration, acts as a read proxy for all model attributes, generate app reference, generate submitted date)
8. Refund model - should be easy - has a few aliases which I may refactor out


From Cathie's discussion
1. DONE Change intro page text to that from Cathies document
2. DONE Original case details - initial state collapsed for address changed and representative
