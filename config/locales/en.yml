# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      ## Fees

      You'll have to pay a [fee](https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunals/apply-to-the-tribunal) (using a debit or credit card) when you submit your form. If your case goes to a hearing, you'll need to pay a second fee.

      If you're on benefits or a low income, you may be able to [pay less or no fee at all](https://www.gov.uk/court-fees-what-they-are).

      ##Before you begin the form

      * try to [sort out the problem with your employer](https://www.gov.uk/solve-workplace-dispute/overview)
      * if you can’t solve the problem, [contact Acas](http://www.acas.org.uk/earlyconciliation) before you apply to an employment tribunal

      ## Information to gather for this form

      * your [Acas early conciliation certificate number](http://www.acas.org.uk/earlyconciliation) (or a reason why you don't need one)

      * details of your pay and benefits, before and after tax (you can find these on your payslip)
      * the full address of the employer or organisation you want to make a claim against

      ## How we use your information

      We send a copy of this form to Acas and the person or organisation you make a claim against.
