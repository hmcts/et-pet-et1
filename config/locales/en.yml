# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      # Take your employer to a tribunal (ET1)

      ## Before you start

      You will need:

        * your early conciliation number (or confirmation that you're exempt)
        * a description of your claim
        * details of your pay and benefits, before and after tax
        * the full address of your employer (respondent)
        * details of your representative, like a solicitor or union, if you have one
        * a credit or debit card to pay any fees

      ## Paying your fees

      When you submit your form you'll be charged a fee to pay for the cost of
      your claim. You may pay less or nothing (remission), eg if you're on
      certain state benefits.

      If your case goes to court you'll have to pay another fee unless you
      qualify for remission. Find out more about paying court and tribunal fees.
