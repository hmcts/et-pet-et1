          You usually have to make a claim to the tribunal within 3 months of your employment ending or the problem happening. In exceptional circumstances the tribunal can accept your claim late. If your claim is late, you must explain why - the tribunal will decide if it can still hear your claim. <a class="govuk-link" href="%{path}#time_limits">Learn about when you can apply</a>.
