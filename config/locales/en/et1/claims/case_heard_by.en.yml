              Non-legal members are lay people appointed because of their particular experience in the workplace as either workers or managers.
              A panel will consist of a judge, a member with worker or union experience and a member with management experience. Each has an equal
              say in the decision.

              the case involves the sort of legal or factual problem where the experience of the non-legal members may help the tribunal react its
              decision.
