<h2 class="legend">How we manage sessions</h2>
This service can be used to complete an application to an employment tribunal. When you use this service, personal information about you may be visible to anyone with access to your computer.
You will stay signed in until you sign out. Your session will expire after 60 minutes of inactivity in order to keep the service secure. If you close the window or navigate away from the service without signing out, your session will remain active.

Each time you sign out (‘save and complete later’), including automatic sign-outs after session expires, the service stores any information you’ve previously saved in a secure database, should you continue your claim at a later date.
We do not store any personal data in cookies. However, your browser may store cookies while you're using the service. You can manage cookie settings on your computer. See our cookies policy for further information.
