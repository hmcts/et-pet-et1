<h2 class="legend">HMCTS Privacy Notice</h2>
##Purpose
This privacy notice sets out the standards that you can expect from the Ministry of Justice and Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) when we process personal information (‘personal data’) about you in the context of employment tribunal proceedings; how you can get access to a copy of your personal data; and what you can do if you think the standards are not being met.

HMCTS is an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). MoJ is the data controller for the personal data held, although it may act jointly with HMCTS. HMCTS also collects and processes personal data for the exercise of its own and associated public functions and legal obligations.

This privacy notice does not apply to the processing of personal data which is collected and controlled by the tribunal and its judges when they are acting in their judicial capacity. The judiciary are independent from MoJ and HMCTS and data protection law applies differently to them as a result. For more information, see <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk" title="More information about Courts and Tribunals Judiciary." target="_blank">www.judiciary.gov.uk</a>.

##About personal data
Personal data is information that relates to a living individual who can be identified from the data.

It does not include information relating to dead people, groups or communities of people, organisations or businesses. It can be your name, address or telephone number. It can also include information about your gender, your financial circumstances, your cultural background or your social status.

We know how important it is to protect the privacy of all individuals involved in tribunal proceedings and to comply with data protection laws. We will safeguard your personal data and will only disclose it where it is lawful to do so, or with your consent.

##How we use your personal data
We use your personal data to complete a claim to an employment tribunal. Any email address you supply to us will be used by HMCTS to contact you with regards to your claim. We may also use your details to contact you for research purposes.

##How we use non-personal data
Separately from the data entered by those using this service, we also collect site-usage data from this service, which allows us to see how the service is being used in order to allow us to improve it. This data does not contain any personal data.

We’ll only ever collect data that will help us make the site work better for you; data that will let us contact you if you’ve asked us to, let us give you accurate data if you need it, and give us a sense of how people are using this service, so we can keep improving it.

It includes:

- questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email address if you send a message via feedback
- your truncated IP address (with the trailing octet removed), and details of which version of web browser you used
- data on how you use the site, using cookies and page tagging techniques to help us improve the website

This helps us to:

- improve the site by monitoring how you use it
- respond to any feedback you send us, if you’ve asked us to
- provide you with information about local services if you want it

We cannot identify you personally using your site usage data.
