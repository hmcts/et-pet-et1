<h2 class="legend">How we use non-personal information</h2>
Separately from the information entered by those using this service, we also collect site-usage information from this service, which allows us to see how the service is being used in order to allow us to improve it. This information does not contain any personal data.

We’ll only ever collect information that will help us make the site work better for you; information that will let us contact you if you’ve asked us to, let us give you accurate information if you need it, and give us a sense of how people are using this service, so we can keep improving it.

It includes:

- questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email address if you send a message via feedback
- your truncated IP address (with the trailing octet removed), and details of which version of web browser you used
- information on how you use the site, using cookies and page tagging techniques to help us improve the website

This helps us to:

- improve the site by monitoring how you use it
- respond to any feedback you send us, if you’ve asked us to
- provide you with information about local services if you want it

We cannot  identify you personally using your site usage data.
