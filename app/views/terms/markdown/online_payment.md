By paying the claim fee (issue fee) online you are paying for your claim to an employment tribunal.
If you use this service to submit your claim online, you will be directed to our payment partner, Barclaycard, for the payment to be processed. The details you submit will be encrypted, in line with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).

HMCTS will not store any of your payment card details. HMCTS is not liable for any information you enter into Barclaycardâ€™s pages, or for the availability of the Barclaycard site. To pay online you must abide by the terms and conditions of your card provider and the providers of the payment system.
