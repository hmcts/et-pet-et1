# Fees

You must pay an ‘issue fee’ when you submit this form and a ‘hearing fee’ just before the tribunal.
 
You may be able to get help with paying the fees (eg, no fee or a reduced fee).
 
The fees you pay depend on your type of case. Complex cases such as unfair dismissal and discrimination cost more than claims about unpaid wages or holiday pay. The fees  for the most common types of case are listed in the table.

|Type of case|Issue fee|Hearing fee|Total|
|------------|---------|-----------|-----|
|Unpaid wage|£160|£230|£390|
|Redundancy pay|£160|£230|£390|
|Holiday pay|£160|£230|£390|
|Notice pay|£160|£230|£390|
|Breach of contract|£160|£230|£390|
|Unfair dismissal|£250|£950|£1200|
|Equal pay|£250|£950|£1200|
|Discrimination|£250|£950|£1200|
|Whistleblowing|£250|£950|£1200|

### When your case involves more than 1 claim
 
Your claim can involve more than 1 type of case (eg, unpaid wages and unfair dismissal), but you only pay 1 issue fee and 1 hearing fee. You pay for the case that has the higher fee.
 
### Example
If you’re claiming for notice pay and discrimination, you only have to pay the higher fees for discrimination (an issue fee of £250 and a hearing fee of £950). You don’t have to pay separate fees for notice pay .
 
 
### Paying your issue fee
 
Unless you’re applying for help with paying your fees, you’ll have to pay your issue fee by debit or credit card when you submit this form.
 
We’ll tell you how much to pay based on the information you give us.

### When you make a claim with other people
 
If you’re making a claim with other people against the same employer, the joint fee that you pay when you submit this form will be higher but you may end up paying a lower fee per person. Find out more by reading ‘Employment tribunal fees for groups and multiples’. [http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetLeaflet.do?court_leaflets_id=2763]
 
 
### If you win the case
 
If you’re successful, the tribunal can order your employer to pay you back the fees you’ve paid, in addition to any award it makes.

## Help with paying the fees
 
### Qualifying for help
You must pass 2 tests to pay a reduced fee or no fee (known as a ‘fee remission’).
 
### Test 1: your ‘disposable capital’
In most cases, you and your partner (if you have one) must have less than £3000 in ‘disposable capital’ (eg, savings and investments) to pass this test.
 
Disposable capital doesn’t include your main home, personal belongings, wages or benefits.
 
### Test 2: your monthly income (before tax and other deductions)
If you pass test 1, you then have to prove that you’re either on benefits or a low income.

### Benefits: no fee
If you get any of these benefits, you won't have to pay a fee:
-  Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
-  Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
-  Income Support
-  Universal Credit (with gross annual earnings of less than £6,000)
-  State Pension Credit - Guarantee Credit
-  Scottish Civil Legal Aid (not ‘advice and assistance’ or ‘advice by way of representation’)

### Low income: no fee or a reduced fee
If you’re not on benefits, but your monthly income (before tax and other deductions) is below a certain threshold, you won’t have to pay a fee:
 
### Monthly income thresholds

|Number of children|If you're single|If you have a partner|
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
|0|£1,085|£1,245|
|1|£1,330|£1,490|
|2|£1,575|£1,735|

If you have 3 or more children there’s an extra allowance of £245 per child.
If your monthly income (before tax and other deductions) is above these thresholds, you’ll have to pay £5 towards your claim fee for every £10 of income you earn above the threshold.

### Applying for help
You must apply for help with paying your fees within 7 days of submitting your online claim. You’ll need to provide evidence or tribunal staff will reject your application and ask you to pay the full fee.
 
Fill in the fee remission form online [www.employmenttribunals.service.gov.uk/remissions] or download the paper form [hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=4396]. 
 
If your case reaches a tribunal, you’ll have to apply for help with paying your hearing fee too.
