# Fees

You must pay an ‘issue fee’ when you submit this form and a ‘hearing fee’ just before the tribunal.
 
You may be able to get help with paying the fees (eg, no fee or a reduced fee).
 
The fees you pay depend on your type of case. Complex cases such as unfair dismissal and discrimination cost more than claims about unpaid wages or holiday pay. The fees  for the most common types of case are listed in the table.

|Type of case|Issue fee|Hearing fee|Total|
|------------|---------|-----------|-----|
|Unpaid wage|£160|£230|£390|
|Redundancy pay|£160|£230|£390|
|Holiday pay|£160|£230|£390|
|Notice pay|£160|£230|£390|
|Breach of contract|£160|£230|£390|
|Unfair dismissal|£250|£950|£1200|
|Equal pay|£250|£950|£1200|
|Discrimination|£250|£950|£1200|
|Whistleblowing|£250|£950|£1200|

### When your case involves more than 1 claim
 
Your claim can involve more than 1 type of case (eg, unpaid wages and unfair dismissal), but you only pay 1 issue fee and 1 hearing fee. You pay for the case that has the higher fee.
 
### Example
If you’re claiming for notice pay and discrimination, you only have to pay the higher fees for discrimination (an issue fee of £250 and a hearing fee of £950). You don’t have to pay separate fees for notice pay .
 
### Paying your issue fee
 
Unless you’re applying for help with paying your fees, you’ll have to pay your issue fee by debit or credit card when you submit this form.
 
We’ll tell you how much to pay based on the information you give us.

### When you make a claim with other people
 
If you’re making a claim with other people against the same employer, the joint fee that you pay when you submit this form will be higher but you may end up paying a lower fee per person.

### If you win the case
 
If you’re successful, the tribunal can order your employer to pay you back the fees you’ve paid, in addition to any award it makes.
