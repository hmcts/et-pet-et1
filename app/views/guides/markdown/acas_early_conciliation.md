# Acas: early conciliation

You must contact Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) to use their free ‘Early Conciliation’ service before applying to an employment tribunal.
 
Fill in the Acas early conciliation notification form [https://ec.acas.org.uk/] or call Acas to provide your information:
 
### Acas
- Telephone: 0300 123 1100
- Textphone: 18001 030 0123 1100
- Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm
- Saturday, 9am to 1pm
 
## Early conciliation certificate
 
You’ll get a certificate from Acas if conciliation doesn’t work.
 
On the certificate is your ‘Acas early conciliation certificate number’, starting ‘R’ or ‘MU’ [I’ve checked with Daniel Thompson. Should also check with Helen Mott].  You must quote this number.

## Time limits
 
The deadline for applying to the tribunal is extended by the amount of time you spend in conciliation.
 
### Example
If you spend 2 weeks in conciliation, the deadline for applying to the tribunal is 2 weeks later.
 
You’ll always get at least 1 month after conciliation to apply to the tribunal.
 
## Claiming against more than one employer
 
If you’re making a claim against more than one employer, you’ll get a certificate and an ‘Acas early conciliation certificate number’ for each employer. You must quote each number.

## When you don’t have to contact Acas
 
You may not have to contact Acas for early conciliation if:
 
- another person you’re making the claim with has an Acas early conciliation certificate number
- Acas doesn't have the power to conciliate on some or all of your claim
- your employer has already been in touch with Acas
- you’re making a claim about a certain type of unfair dismissal that allows you to apply for 'interim relief' [link to interim relief section in this guide], and it’s within 7 days of the dismissal
- your claim is against the Security Service, Secret Intelligence Service or GCHQ
 
If you think you don’t need to contact Acas, you may want to get legal advice before you start your claim.
 
### Interim relief
If you apply for interim relief, and the tribunal grants it to you, your employer has to continue your employment. You’ll receive your salary or wages until the case is decided.
 
You can only apply for interim relief if you say you’ve been dismissed for certain reasons, such as whistleblowing, trade union activities or acting as a workers’ representative.
 
The tribunal must receive your claim and application for interim relief within 7 days of your dismissal.
 
If you’re applying for interim relief, you don’t have to contact Acas for early conciliation.
