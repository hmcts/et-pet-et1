<h2 class="legend">Time limits</h2>

In most cases the tribunal must receive your claim within 3 months:

- in dismissal cases the 3 month period begins from the date your employment ended
- in discrimination cases, or complaints relating to non-payment of wages or holiday pay, the 3 month period begins when the matter youâ€™re complaining about happened

Before applying to an employment tribunal you have to contact Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) to use their free <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/earlyconciliation" rel="external">Early Conciliation service</a>. The time limit for applying is paused while Acas tries to help you settle the dispute.
