<h2 class="legend">Time limits</h2>

In most cases the tribunal must receive your claim within 3 months:

- in dismissal cases the 3 month period begins from the date your employment ended
- in discrimination cases, or complaints relating to non-payment of wages or holiday pay, the 3 month period begins when the matter you are complaining about happened

Before applying to an employment tribunal you have to contact Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) to use their free [Early Conciliation service](http://www.acas.org.uk/earlyconciliation). The time limit for applying is paused while Acas tries to help you settle the dispute.
