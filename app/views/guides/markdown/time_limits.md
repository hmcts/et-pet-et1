##Time limits

You must apply to the tribunal within 3 months of the problem at work happening.  

- if you think youâ€™ve lost your job unfairly the 3 month period begins from the date your employment ended
- if your claim is about discrimination or a dispute over pay, the 3 month period begins when the incident or dispute happened  

Before applying to an employment tribunal you must contact Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) to use their free <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/earlyconciliation" rel="external">Early Conciliation</a> service.

The time limit for applying is put on hold while Acas helps you settle the dispute.
