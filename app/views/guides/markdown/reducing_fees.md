##Reducing fees

To pay a lower fee or no fee (known as ‘fee remission’), you’ll need to prove that:

1.  In most cases you (and your partner if you have one) have less than £3000 in savings and investments. This is known as ‘disposable capital’ and doesn’t include your main home, personal belongings, wages or benefits.


2.  You’re either on benefits or have a low income.

### Benefits

If you receive any of these benefits, you won't have to pay a fee:

* Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
* Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
* Income Support
* Universal Credit (with gross annual earnings of less than £6,000)
* State Pension Credit - Guarantee Credit
* Scottish Civil Legal Aid (not ‘advice and assistance’ or ‘advice by way of representation’)

### Low income

If your monthly income (before tax and other deductions) is equal to or less than the amount set out below, you won’t have to pay a fee.

|Number of children|If you’re single|If you have a partner|
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
|0|£1,085|£1,245|
|1|£1,330|£1,490|
|2|£1,575|£1,735|

If you have 3 or more children there’s an extra allowance of £245 for each child.

If your monthly income (before tax and other deductions) is more than these amounts you’ll have to pay £5 towards your fee for every £10 of income you earn above the threshold.

### Applying for a fee reduction
Download and complete a <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/courtfinder/forms/ex160a-eng.pdf" rel="external">fee remission form</a>. If claiming in England or Wales, email your completed remission form to <a href="mailto:eremissions@hmcts.gsi.gov.uk">eREMISSIONS@hmcts.gsi.gov.uk</a>.

If claiming in Scotland (or you would prefer to post your form), you can find the relevant address in section 8 of the <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/courtfinder/forms/ex160a-eng.pdf" rel="external">fee remission form guide</a>.

You will be given another opportunity to apply for fee remission at the end of the claim.

If your case reaches a tribunal, you’ll need to apply for help with paying your hearing fee separately.


### Reducing fees for groups

Before applying for a reduction in fees you must  submit your online application.

If you’re making a joint claim with other people against the same employer then your group will pay a single fee.

Each individual within a group can apply to pay lower fees  by following the process outlined in the ‘  [applying for help with fees](#applying_for_a_fee_reduction)’ section.

If one or more people  have their fees reduced, the rest of the group will pay the remaining fee.  

In a case where there are multiple people making a claim, and some pay a reduced fee, no single person will have to pay more than  they would, had they applied on their own.
