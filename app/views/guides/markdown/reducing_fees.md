## Help with fees

You may not have to pay a fee, or you may get some money off if you're on a low income or receiving certain benefits, and have a small amount of savings and investments. To be eligible for help with fees, you’ll need to prove that:

1.  In most cases you (and your partner if you have one) have less than £3,000 in savings and investments. This doesn’t include your main home, personal belongings, wages or benefits.


2.  You’re either on benefits or have a low income.

### Benefits

If you receive any of these benefits, you won't have to pay a fee:

* Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
* Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
* Income Support
* Universal Credit
* Pension Credit (Guarantee Credit)
* Scottish Civil Legal Aid

### Low income

If you earn less a month than the amounts in the table below (before tax and National Insurance has been taken off) then you won't have to pay a fee. This can include benefits, eg working tax credit, child tax credit.

|Number of children|If you’re single|If you have a partner|
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
|0|£1,085|£1,245|
|1|£1,330|£1,490|
|2|£1,575|£1,735|

If you have 3 or more children there’s an extra allowance of £245 for each child.

If your monthly income (before tax and National Insurance has been taken off) is more than these amounts you’ll have to pay £5 towards your fee for every £10 of income you earn above the threshold.

You will be given another opportunity to apply for help with fees at the end of the claim.

If your case reaches a tribunal, you’ll need to apply for help with paying your hearing fee separately.


### Reducing fees for groups

Before applying for a reduction in fees you must  submit your online application.

If you’re making a joint claim with other people against the same employer then your group will pay a single fee.

Each individual within a group can apply to pay lower fees  by following the process outlined in the ‘  [applying for help with fees](#applying_for_a_fee_reduction)’ section.

If one or more people  have their fees reduced, the rest of the group will pay the remaining fee.

In a case where there are multiple people making a claim, and some pay a reduced fee, no single person will have to pay more than  they would, had they applied on their own.
