## Reducing fees

To pay a reduced fee or no fee (known as ‘fee remission’), you’ll need to prove that:

* In most cases, you (and your partner if you have one) have ‘disposable capital’ of less than £3000. Disposable capital means savings and investments; it doesn’t include your main home, personal belongings, wages or benefits.<br/><br/>
* That you’re either on benefits or have a low income.<br/><br/>

### Benefits

If you receive any of these benefits, you won't have to pay a fee:

- Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
- Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
- Income Support
- Universal Credit (with gross annual earnings of less than £6,000)
- State Pension Credit - Guarantee Credit
- Scottish Civil Legal Aid (not ‘advice and assistance’ or ‘advice by way of representation’)<br/><br/>

### Low income
If you’re not on benefits but your monthly income (before tax and other deductions) is equal to or less than the amount set out below, you won’t have to pay a fee.

|Number of children|If you’re single|If you have a partner|
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
|0|£1,085|£1,245|
|1|£1,330|£1,490|
|2|£1,575|£1,735|

If you have 3 or more children there’s an extra allowance of £245 for each child.
If your monthly income (before tax and other deductions) is more than these amounts you’ll have to pay £5 towards your fee for every £10 of income you earn above the threshold.

### Applying for a fee reduction
Before applying for a reduction in fees you should complete and submit your online application.

You must apply for a reduction in your fees (known as fee remission) within 7 days of submitting your application online.

You’ll need to provide evidence or your application will be rejected and you’ll be asked to pay the full fee. [Download a fee remission form](http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=4396).

If your case reaches a tribunal, you’ll need to apply for help with paying your hearing fee separately.


### Reducing fees for groups
Before applying for a reduction in fees you should complete and submit your online application.

If you’re making a claim with other people against the same employer, within the same online application, then your group will pay a single fee.

Individual claimants within a group can apply for fee remission by following the process outlined in the ‘[applying for help with fees](#applying_for_a_fee_reduction)’ section.

If one or more claimants are granted a remission, the remaining claimants will become responsible for the fee.

In a case where there are multiple claimants and some claimants are granted a remission, no claimant will have to pay more than they would if they had applied on their own.
