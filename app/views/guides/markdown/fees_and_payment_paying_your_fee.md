### Paying your fee
Unless you’re applying for help with reducing your fees (see below), you’ll have to pay the issue fee by debit or credit card when you submit your claim. This will need to be made in one single payment.

If your claim goes to a tribunal, you’ll be contacted about paying the hearing fee.
