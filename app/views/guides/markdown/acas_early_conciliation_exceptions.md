### Exceptions to early conciliation

You may not have to contact Acas for early conciliation if:

- you're making the claim with another person who's already been through early conciliation
- Acas doesn't have the power to conciliate on some or all of your claim
- your employer has already been in touch with Acas - you'll need to provide evidence of this
- you're making a claim about a certain type of unfair dismissal that allows you to apply for ['interim relief'](#interim-relief) and it's within 7 days of the dismissal
- your claim is against the Security Service, Secret Intelligence Service or GCHQ

If you think you don't need to contact Acas, you may want to get legal advice before you start your claim.

###Interim relief

Interim relief is when an employment tribunal orders an employer or business to give the job back to someone they sacked until a hearing happens.

If you're applying for interim relief, you don't have to contact Acas for early conciliation.

You can only apply for interim relief if your claim  is for certain reasons such as whistleblowing, trade union activities or acting as a workers' representative.

The tribunal must receive your claim and application for interim relief within 7 days of you losing your job.
