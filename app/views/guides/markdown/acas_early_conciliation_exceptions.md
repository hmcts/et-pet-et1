### Exceptions to early conciliation
You may not have to contact Acas for early conciliation if:

- you’re making the claim with another person who already has an Acas early conciliation certificate number
- Acas doesn't have the power to conciliate on some or all of your claim
- your employer has already been in touch with Acas
- you’re making a claim about a certain type of unfair dismissal that allows you to apply for ’[interim relief](#interim_relief)’ and it’s within 7 days of the dismissal
- your claim is against the Security Service, Secret Intelligence Service or GCHQ

If you think you don’t need to contact Acas, you may want to get legal advice before you start your claim.

### Interim relief
If you’re applying for interim relief, you don’t have to contact Acas for early conciliation.

Interim relief is a special measure where an employment tribunal can make an order for continued employment of a claimant who has has been dismissed pending a full hearing.

You can only apply for interim relief if you claim you’ve been dismissed for certain reasons such as whistleblowing, trade union activities or acting as a workers’ representative.

The tribunal must receive your claim and claim for interim relief within 7 days of your dismissal.

If the tribunal agrees to give you interim relief, your employer has to continue your employment until the hearing considers the major part of your claim. You’ll receive your salary or wages until the case is decided.
