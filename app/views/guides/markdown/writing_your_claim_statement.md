## Writing your claim statement

Describe your problem at work. It should explain to the person you're making the claim against (the respondent), and the tribunal what happened. Make sure you include:

- relevant background information
- dates of the incidents
- names of the people involved

Write in short paragraphs. Describe events as they happened, giving details of witnesses and any evidence you have. Don’t attach evidence documents.

See below for specific guidance relating to each type of claim:

__Unfair dismissal and constructive dismissal__

- describe what happened
- say what you think the reason was for dismissal
- say why you think the dismissal was unfair

__Discrimination__

- describe what happened
- explain how you were discriminated against
- give the date(s) of the incident(s)
- state whether the discrimination is still happening
- if you’re claiming more than one type of discrimination, provide details about each type
- describe how you’ve been affected by the discrimination
- if you applied for a job and were discriminated against, say what the job title was

__Pay__

- state how much you’re claiming and explain how you worked it out
- explain why you think you should receive this payment (include dates and rate of pay)
- if you’re claiming more than one type of payment, provide amounts for each one

__Redundancy payment__
