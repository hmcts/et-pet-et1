## Writing your claim statement

This is a description of your problem at work. It should support your claim and explain to the respondent (the person you're making the claim against) and the tribunal what happened. Include all relevant background information, the dates of the incidents and the people involved.

Write in short paragraphs, describing events in the order they happened. Give details of the people involved, witnesses and any evidence you have. Please do not attach evidence documents. See below for specific guidance relating to each type of claim:

__Unfair dismissal and constructive dismissal__

- say why you think the dismissal was unfair

__Discrimination__

- describe what happened and explain in what way you believe you were discriminated against
- give the date(s) of the incident(s). State whether the discrimination is still happening
- if you’re claiming more than one type of discrimination, provide details about each type
- describe how you’ve been affected by the discrimination
- if you applied for a job and were discriminated against, say what job it was

__Pay__
