# Help with paying the fees
 
### Qualifying for help
You must pass 2 tests to pay a reduced fee or no fee (known as a ‘fee remission’).
 
### Test 1: your ‘disposable capital’
In most cases, you and your partner (if you have one) must have less than £3000 in ‘disposable capital’ (eg, savings and investments) to pass this test.
 
Disposable capital doesn’t include your main home, personal belongings, wages or benefits.
 
### Test 2: your monthly income (before tax and other deductions)
If you pass test 1, you then have to prove that you’re either on benefits or a low income.

### Benefits: no fee
If you get any of these benefits, you won't have to pay a fee:
-  Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
-  Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
-  Income Support
-  Universal Credit (with gross annual earnings of less than £6,000)
-  State Pension Credit - Guarantee Credit
-  Scottish Civil Legal Aid (not ‘advice and assistance’ or ‘advice by way of representation’)

### Low income: no fee or a reduced fee
If you’re not on benefits, but your monthly income (before tax and other deductions) is below a certain threshold, you won’t have to pay a fee:
 
### Monthly income thresholds

|Number of children|If you're single|If you have a partner|
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
|0|£1,085|£1,245|
|1|£1,330|£1,490|
|2|£1,575|£1,735|

If you have 3 or more children there’s an extra allowance of £245 per child.
If your monthly income (before tax and other deductions) is above these thresholds, you’ll have to pay £5 towards your claim fee for every £10 of income you earn above the threshold.

### Applying for help
You must apply for help with paying your fees within 7 days of submitting your online claim. You’ll need to provide evidence or tribunal staff will reject your application and ask you to pay the full fee.
