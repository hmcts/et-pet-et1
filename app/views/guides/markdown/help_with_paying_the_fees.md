# Help with paying the fees
 
### Qualifying for help
You must pass 2 tests to pay a reduced fee or no fee (known as a ‘fee remission’).
 
### Test 1: your ‘disposable capital’
In most cases, you and your partner (if you have one) must have less than £3000 in ‘disposable capital’ (eg, savings and investments) to pass this test.
 
Disposable capital doesn’t include your main home, personal belongings, wages or benefits.
 
### Test 2: your monthly income (before tax and other deductions)
If you pass test 1, you then have to prove that you’re either on benefits or a low income.

### Benefits: no fee
If you get any of these benefits, you won't have to pay a fee:
-  Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
-  Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
-  Income Support
-  Universal Credit (with gross annual earnings of less than £6,000)
-  State Pension Credit - Guarantee Credit
-  Scottish Civil Legal Aid (not ‘advice and assistance’ or ‘advice by way of representation’)

### Low income: no fee or a reduced fee
If you’re not on benefits, but your monthly income (before tax and other deductions) is below a certain threshold, you won’t have to pay a fee:
 
### Monthly income thresholds

|Number of children|If you're single|If you have a partner|
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
|0|£1,085|£1,245|
|1|£1,330|£1,490|
|2|£1,575|£1,735|

If you have 3 or more children there’s an extra allowance of £245 per child.
If your monthly income (before tax and other deductions) is above these thresholds, you’ll have to pay £5 towards your claim fee for every £10 of income you earn above the threshold.

### Applying for help
You must apply for help with paying your fees within 7 days of submitting your online claim. You’ll need to provide evidence or tribunal staff will reject your application and ask you to pay the full fee.
 
Fill in the fee remission form online [www.employmenttribunals.service.gov.uk/remissions] or download the paper form [hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=4396]. 
 
If your case reaches a tribunal, you’ll have to apply for help with paying your hearing fee too.
