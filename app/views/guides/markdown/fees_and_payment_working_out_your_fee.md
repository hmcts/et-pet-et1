### Group claims
If you’re making a claim with other people against the same employer, as part of the same online application, then your group will pay a single issue fee. The amount your group pays depends on:

- the type of claim you are making
- the types of claims the rest of the group are making
- the number of people in the group
- whether any in the group are applying for a reduction in fees (fee remission)

|Number of people named on the claim form|Type A|Mixture of type<br/>A and type B,or<br> type B claims only|
|----------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|Between 2 and 10|£320|£500|
|Between 11 and 200|£640|£1,000|
|201 or more|£960|£1,500|

If your group claim makes it to a hearing, then your group will also pay a single hearing fee.

|Number of people named on the claim form|Type A|Mixture of type<br/>A and type B,or<br> type B claims only|
|----------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|Between 2 and 10|£460|£1900|
|Between 11 and 200|£920|£3,800|
|201 or more|£1,380|£5,700|

### Multiple claim types
If your case involves more than one type of claim, you’ll only pay for the claim that has the higher fee. So if your claim is about holiday pay and discrimination, you’ll only be charged fees for the discrimination claim, not for your holiday pay claim as well.
