### Group claims
If you’re making a joint claim with other people against the same employer then your group will pay a single issue fee. The amount your group pays depends on:  

- the type of claim you are making
- the types of claims the rest of the group are making
- the number of people in the group
- whether anyone in the group is applying to pay lower fees (help with fees)

### Multiple claims
If your case involves more than one type of claim, you’ll only pay for the claim that has the higher fee. So if your claim is about holiday pay and discrimination, you’ll only be charged fees for the discrimination claim.
